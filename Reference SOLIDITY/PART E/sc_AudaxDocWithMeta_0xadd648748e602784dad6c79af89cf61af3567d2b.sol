ENTROPY TOKEN SALE TERMS
If you pay us what we ask for,
we promise to assign a number of Entropy Tokens to your address,
or return your unused payment to you.
These are the Terms.

Important Notice
* Do not apply or pay for Entropy Tokens unless you fully understand what you are
paying for and you accept the risks.

* Before applying, please read Entropy Foundation’s current Token Disclosure
Statement (TDS) for a summary of significant features and risks.
No disclosure document (including any white paper) can fully cover all features and
risks, so please carefully consider your situation before applying.
Entropy Foundation’s current TDS is on Entropy Foundation’s Website and may be
updated from time to time.

* The futures of HUT34, the Entropy Foundation and Entropy Token are highly
speculative.
There is no assurance of the future performance of any of them.
Participation in HUT34 and the Token Sale is targeted for developers. It is not
suitable for speculators or for financial investment.

* These Terms are binding on the offer we make to you and on the sale of Entropy
Token to you.
No other terms (whether written by you or us or implied) affect these Terms unless
they are mandatorily imposed by law and we cannot contract out of that.

* You can only apply for Entropy Token through our Website.
You must accept and agree to be bound by these Terms for your participation in the
Token Sale.
No-one other than Entropy Foundation is authorised to offer or to make
statements on behalf on behalf of Entropy Foundation. Guard against scams,
phishing and hackers.

* You are not offered any financial product, financial service or investment
opportunity.

Do not apply for Entropy Token for speculative financial gains.

There is no regulated disclosure document or token sale process applying to the
Token Sale.

If any country’s laws prohibit or specifically regulate any part of the Token
Sale under financial or securities laws, then no offer or sale may occur under
the Token Sale as far as those laws actually apply.
Entropy Foundation may cancel, limit, transfer or modify any step of the Token
Sale to ensure compliance with the Terms and any country’s laws.

Terms
1. Application of these Terms
1.1 These terms (as amended from time to time – see clause 17.18) exclusively govern the legal
relationship between you (Applicant) and Entropy Foundation in the Token Sale. This includes
receiving, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens and your use of the Website, subject only to
any law which cannot be excluded by these Terms.
1.2 The Token Sale includes the offer made to you, your application, our decision whether to
accept your application (in full or in part) and our completion of all accepted offers.
1.3 If you participate in the Token Sale, you will be deemed to have conclusively and irrevocably
accepted all of the Terms (without any counter-offer, amendment or ancillary agreements or
terms asserted by you). You cannot counter-offer or change these Terms. If you do not agree
to these Terms, then do not participate in the Token Sale.
1.4 Entropy Foundation controls the Token Sale. No other person represents or binds Entropy
Foundation in the Token Sale.
2. Timing of Token Sale
2.1 The Token Sale will begin at the Commencement Time and will end at the Closing Time. Those
dates (and times) will be specified on the Website.
2.2 Entropy Foundation may change the Commencement Time or the Closing Time in its absolute
discretion. Any such changes will be notified on the Website and will be effectively immediately
at the time of being published on the Website (without any other notice).
2.3 Entropy Foundation may in its absolute discretion end the Token Sale and may withdraw any
offers to allocate or to assign Entropy Tokens before the Closing Time (for clarity, without
having to amend the Closing Time or to give notice to anyone).
3. Website
3.1 Entropy Foundation may, in its absolute discretion and without giving prior notice:
(a) vary, modify, add or remove features, or amend any content on the Website; and
(b) block or restrict access to, or terminate, withdraw or suspend use of, the Website or any
part of the Website.
Those changes apply to you whether or not you continue to access or to use the Website.
No Entropy Foundation Person will be liable for any Loss which is incurred as a result of such
action.
3.2 Entropy Foundation may remove any user generated content from the Website:
(a) in its absolute discretion and without giving prior notice; and
(b) at the request of a user.
3.3 Entropy Foundation Persons are not responsible for, and will not be liable for, any user
generated content posted to the Website. Entropy Foundation Persons will not be liable for any
Loss arising from such content or from the failure of Entropy Foundation to moderate, delete or
correct any such content.
3.4 Entropy Foundation may arrange for the Website to accept registrations of interest in the Token
Sale. Any registration of interest is limited to a facility to advise registrants of the availability of
the Token Sale and to receive news and updates. It is not an application for Entropy Token and
gives no right to allocations to Entropy Tokens. All registrants are solely responsible for taking
the steps to apply for Entropy Tokens as set out on the Website (in accordance with these
Terms). (For clarity, such a facility to accept registrations of interest will be different from any
facilities for allocations prior to the public availability of the Token Sale.)
3.5 The Website may contain hyperlinks to websites which are not maintained or controlled by
Entropy Foundation. All hyperlinks to such websites are provided as a convenience to you.
Use of the hyperlinks and access to such websites is entirely at your own risk. No Entropy
Foundation Person is responsible for any third-party content contained in websites linked to the
Website. No Entropy Foundation Person is liable for any Loss arising from accessing, using or
relying on such websites.
3.6 The inclusion of any hyperlink does not imply endorsement by Entropy Foundation of such
websites. Entropy Foundation is not the partner, associate, agent or other representative of any
person who is named on the Website or whose trademark, service marks, logo, insignia or other
device is used on or appears on websites to which the Website is linked.
4. Token Sale
4.1 Applicant must apply to buy Entropy Tokens only through the Website.
4.2 By applying for Entropy Token through the Website, Applicant irrevocably agrees to these
Terms (as may be amended after their application in accordance with these Terms).
4.3 All applications for Entropy Token are irrevocable. They may not be withdrawn prior to the end
of the Token Sale with the express written consent of Entropy Foundation notified to Applicant.
4.4 Any applications which are not allocated in full or in part as at the end of the Token Sale
automatically lapse.
4.5 Entropy Foundation may terminate the Token Sale at any time, without notice, and regardless of
the amount of Entropy Tokens allocated.
4.6 Applicant’s application to buy Entropy Tokens is subject to Entropy Foundation’s sole discretion
to accept the application, in whole or in part.
4.7 Entropy Foundation will comply with all express written representations it makes on its Website
about the Token Sale. This includes, but is not limited to, caps on issuance, pricing and
allocation of Entropy Tokens.
4.8 The TDS does not provide any representation, warranty, undertaking, assurance or give rise to
any other conduct (or omission) which affects these Terms or which independently gives any
person any legal rights or expectations.
4.9 The fixed limit on the total number of Entropy Tokens is 100,000,000 Entropy Tokens. The limit
that will be generated will be referenced in the smart contract code for the Entropy Token. (see
clause 9.1.)
4.10 Applicant must pay Entropy Foundation for the number of Entropy Tokens applied for at the
price offered by Entropy Foundation and in the forms (including digicurrencies or fiat currencies)
notified on the Website. The offered price (as notified on the Website) may differ according to
the timing of applications and the number of Entropy Tokens applied for. Entropy Foundation
decides how to apply the pricing which is stated on the Website from time to time.
4.11 Applicant acknowledges that failure to follow the Token Sale instructions on the Website or any
difficulties in transferring payment may limit, delay, or prevent Applicant from applying for and
acquiring Entropy Tokens. Any questions about such instructions should be directed to
